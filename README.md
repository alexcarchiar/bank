# Bank Management System
This is a small Bank management system that I am developing.

I am developing to learn a few things here and there about how banks work and how to do proper software engineering.

I am Italian so my system will try to follow the European banking one, but I am pretty confident that with slight variation it is possible to adapt it to other banking systems as well.

This project is under MIT license and I would appreciate any suggestions to make my system a better one. If any of you ends up using any part of my source code or database logical schema, I would appreciate being mentioned.
Thank you!
